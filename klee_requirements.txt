# System Dependencies for KLEE (REFERENCE ONLY)
# 
# These packages would normally be required for KLEE installation,
# but our setup script builds everything from source in user space.
# 
# If you have admin access and prefer system packages:
# sudo yum install -y sqlite-devel zlib-devel bison flex libcap-devel
# sudo yum install -y llvm-devel clang z3-devel

# Build tools (handled by setup script)
cmake               # -> /scratch/user/cmake/
ninja-build         # -> /scratch/user/ninja/
python3             # System requirement

# LLVM/Clang toolchain (built from source)
llvm-14             # -> /scratch/user/llvm-14/
clang-14            # -> /scratch/user/llvm-14/bin/clang

# Solver support (built from source)
z3                  # -> /scratch/user/z3-build/
libz3-dev           # -> /scratch/user/z3-build/lib/

# C library support (built from source)  
sqlite              # -> /scratch/user/sqlite/
libsqlite3-dev      # -> /scratch/user/sqlite/lib/

# System libraries (required - should be available)
zlib1g-dev          # Usually available system-wide
bison               # For parser generation (not critical)
flex                # For lexer generation (not critical)
